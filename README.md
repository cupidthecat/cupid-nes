## Test Results

The emulator has been tested with various NES test ROMs to verify correct implementation of CPU instructions, PPU functionality, and overall emulation accuracy.

### CPU Tests

**Nestest Results**

This test verifies interrupt handling and timing accuracy, particularly for CLI (Clear Interrupt Disable) instruction behavior.

### Test ROMs Included

The project includes several test ROMs for validation:
- `nestest.nes` - Comprehensive CPU instruction testing
- `1-cli_latency.nes` - Interrupt timing validation
- `color_test.nes` - PPU color and palette testing

## Requirements

- **Compiler:** GCC (or any C compiler that supports C99)
- **Operating System:** Linux or any POSIX-compliant system
- **Build Tools:** Make
- **Libraries:** SDL2 (for graphical output)

## Installation & Usage

### Building the Emulator

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile all source files and create an executable named `cupid-nes`.

### Running with a ROM

To load and run an NES ROM:

```bash
./cupid-nes path/to/rom.nes
```

The emulator will:
- Load the ROM and print header information
- Initialize the CPU and PPU
- Open an SDL window and begin execution
- Display background and sprite graphics in real time

### Keyboard Controls

- **Z** â€“ A button
- **X** â€“ B button
- **Right Shift** â€“ Select button
- **Enter** â€“ Start button
- **Arrow Keys** â€“ D-Pad (Up, Down, Left, Right)

## Emulation Details

### CPU Cycle Timing

The emulator approximates NTSC NES timing:

- CPU frequency: 1,789,773 Hz
- Frame rate: 60 Hz
- CPU cycles per frame: ~29,796
- Frames include a VBlank period where the PPU stops rendering

### Addressing Mode Implementation

The CPU includes proper 6502 quirks:

- Page-boundary crossing with dummy reads on indexed addressing modes
- 6502 indirect addressing bug in JMP (Absolute Indirect)
- Stack pointer wrapping at 0x00/0xFF
- Proper flag updates and preserved carry behavior in shift/rotate operations

### PPU Memory Management

- Nametable mirroring respects ROM configuration (horizontal/vertical/single-screen/four-screen)
- Palette RAM with special $3F10/$3F14/$3F18/$3F1C mirroring to $3F00
- Proper VRAM address latching for $2005 (scroll) and $2006 (address) writes
- Read buffer behavior for $2007 (palette reads bypass buffer)
- Open bus behavior for unused register reads
- Sprite priority handling (background vs foreground)

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- **Mapper Support:** Currently supports mappers 0-4, 7, 9-11, 13, and 15. Additional mappers would expand ROM compatibility
- **Cycle Accuracy:** Current timing is approximate; true cycle-accurate emulation would improve compatibility
- **APU Features:** DMC (sample playback) channel is stubbed out and not fully implemented
- **MMC3 IRQ:** Mapper 4 IRQ support is implemented but may need refinement for some games
- **Debugging Tools:** An integrated debugger with breakpoints and memory inspection would aid development
- **Performance:** Further optimization for high-resolution or high-speed rendering
- **Save States:** Not yet implemented
